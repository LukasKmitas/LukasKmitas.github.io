							<p>The player starts off with 1 building (Headquarters), you can see only a small area which is only around your base this is called "Fog of war"
								you either expand by adding buildings or make a unit to go explore it to see more of the map.
								Left click on that building opens a GUI panel on the right side, from there you can select which building the player would like to select,
								a ghost of that building shall appear on the mouse position. It would be either red or green which tells if the player is allowed to build.
								To confirm the building placement you need to right click to place it down.</p>
