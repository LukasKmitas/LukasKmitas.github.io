							<span class="image fit"><img src="gifs/GG_Menu.gif" alt="Menu Overview" /></span>
							<p><b>Beginning</b></p>
							<p>Players start with a headquarters building, limited visibility surrounding this base due to the "fog of war." 
								Players can expand their visible area by constructing additional buildings or deploying units to explore the map. 
								Left-clicking on a building opens a GUI panel on the right side, where players can select buildings to place. 
								A placement ghost appears at the mouse cursor, color-coded red or green to indicate whether placement is permitted. Right-clicking confirms the building placement.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="gifs/GG_buildingPlacement.gif" alt=" Building placement overview" /></span>

							<p>Players can sell buildings to gain currency, except for the main building. Currency is used for creating both buildings and units.<br/>
								The game includes four building types:<br/></p>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Refinery:</b> Generates money by deploying a Harvester unit that collects resources and returns them to the refinery.</li>
								<li><b>Barracks:</b> Produces infantry units.</li>
								<li><b>War Factory:</b> Produces vehicles like tanks and buggies.</li>
								<li><b>AirCraft:</b> Produces air units such as helicopters.</li>
							</ul>

							<p><b>Units</b><br/>
								There are 3 classes of units:<br/>
								Infantry<br/>
								Vehicles<br/>
								Air
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Rifleman Squad - Infantry:</b> A cost-effective unit produced from the barracks. Composed of multiple entities, it fires basic bullets. Entities die off as the squad takes damage.</li>

								<li><b>Harvester - Vehicle:</b> Created from the War Factory or spawned for free by building a refinery. This non-combat unit collects resources from discovered tiles and returns them to the refinery for processing into currency.</li>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/harvester.png" style="width: 30%; height: auto;" alt="Harvester" /></span>
								<li><b>Buggy - Vehicle:</b> Excellent for scouting due to its speed and omnidirectional turret.</li>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/buggy.png" style="width: 30%; height: auto;" alt="Buggy" /></span>
								<li><b>Tank Aurora - Vehicle:</b> A support/debuff unit with a healing aura and an EMP attack that disables enemies.</li>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/tankAurora.png" style="width: 30%; height: auto;" alt="Tank Aurora" /></span>
								<li><b>HammerHead - Air:</b> Equipped with guns on both wings, it delivers high damage with poor accuracy over a wide area.</li>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/HammerHead.png" style="width: 30%; height: auto;" alt="HammerHead" /></span>
								<li><b>FireHawk - Air:</b> Fires four rockets in two phases, delivering high damage.</li>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/fireHawk.png" style="width: 30%; height: auto;" alt="FireHawk" /></span>
							</ul>

							<span class="image fit"><img src="gifs/GG_gameplay1.gif" style="width: 60%; height: auto;" alt=" Building placement overview" /></span>

							<p><b>Enemy</b></p>
							<p>The enemy creates either a building within its view or a unit every few seconds, it goes through 3 phases:<br/>
								Exploring: The enemy sends its units to explore the map<br/>
								Grouping: It will start to group some units making a small army<br/>
								Attacking: As the name suggests the enemy will start to attack the player for a certain duration
							</p>

							<p><b>Victory Conditions</b><br/>
								To win in this game you need to destroy all the enemy buildings and you lose if the player bases are destroyed.<br/>
								After the game ends it will show you some stats how many unit/buildings both player and enemy has created and how long the match went for.
							</p>

							<p><b>Visual and Audio Effects</b></p>
            				<ul>
                				<li><b>Particle Effects:</b> Includes bubbles for the underwater theme, sparks and trails for bullets and missiles, and engine flames on the HammerHead.</li>
                				<li><b>Shaders:</b> Used to enhance visuals, such as a wavy effect on the main menu title.</li>
                				<li><b>Animations:</b> Resource tiles and other elements feature animations to enhance visibility and aesthetic appeal.</li>
                				<li><b>Music/Sound:</b> Background music in the main menu and a gameplay playlist prevent repetitive audio. Sound effects are tailored for each unit's actions.</li>
            				</ul>
